Pork Shoulder/Boston Butt

Prep

-This is my first time cooking one of these. I chose an 8lb butt and rubbed it down with two different rubs. I used 3 parts of Williams Food Co. Rib Tickler for Pork and Chicken - a very Memphis Style rub and added 1 part of Salt Lick Dry Rub Original that is heavy in black pepper. I injected the shoulder with Creole Butter and it sat in the fridge for about 20 hours soaking it all in.

-I set up the fire with oak hardwood lump charcoal and added a bunch of chunks of hickory wood on top. Got the fire going, put the place setter in the Green Egg and placed a drip tray full of hot water on top with the grill over that. 

The cook

-The fire was steady with the temp at the dome at 250F - should be about 225F where the shoulder sits. Internal temp of the shoulder was about 46F after sitting out at room temp for 4 hours. After placing the shoulder on the grill, the temp at the dome spiked up to about 275F and over the next 30mins dropped back to 250F. The smoke was pretty thick and heavy for the first 30mins, then moderate and clean after that.

-1 hour in- Misted the shoulder with a 1 to 1 mix of Bulleit Bourbon and apple cider vinegar. Drip tray was still full. The butt had a nice light brown/dark red color. Looked very moist.

-2 hours- Misted again. Color was brown with a hint of ornage and a bark was starting to form in a few places. Steady light smoke. Internal temp of the shoulder was 107F.

-3 hours- Misted again. Color was dark brown and bark is coming along. Fire has been steady with light smoke. Drip tray still has plenty of liquid - now a mix of water and drippings. Temp has been steady just under 250F at the dome and the internal temp was up to 131F.

-4 hours- Misted again. Color was dark brown and the bark is getting thick. It needed misting this time - the places where the bark was the thickest looks a little dry. The drip tray was still full though and all the exhaust air (when the lid is closed) is still very moist.

-4 hours and 45mins on the pit. Took it off the pit, misted it and placed in a small metal pan and covered tightly with foil. Put it in the oven to finish cooking over night at 200F. Since it will be in the oven for so long I didn't want to set the temp too high and risk over cooking it. Internal temp is 143F.

The Next Morning

-12:20 cook time- Sat in the oven all night at 200F but the internal temp is only 179F. Took it out to inspect and it's coming along great, just not ready yet. The bone wouldn't pull out easy and the meat is definitely not tender yet. Increased the oven temp to 235F. Pan is full of juices and it smells great. The fat cap on top is rendering well.
