Pork Shoulder/Boston Butt

Prep

-I use 3 parts of Williams Food Co. Rib Tickler for Pork and Chicken - a sweet and salty rub and added 1 part of Salt Lick Dry Rub Original that is heavy in black pepper. I've injected the shoulder with Creole Butter and it came out great and I've also not injected and it came out great. Your choice depending on the flavor you're looking for. Either way, it's a decent idea to let it sit in the fridge over night in whatever rub and/or injection you choose.

-I set up the fire with oak hardwood lump charcoal. I've used hickory chuncks before for the smoke, but I really prefer using oak wood. Get the fire going, put the place setter in the Green Egg and place a drip tray full of hot water on top with the grill over that. 

The cook

-The good thing about the pork shoulder is the fat content - the marbeling, even on cheap cuts, is awesome. That means it's a very forgiving (easy) cut of meat to cook. With any bbq you want to maintain a constant temperature but if you're not paying as close attention and the temp swings up or down slightly, the shoulder will handle it well and you'll still have a great final product (unlike a brisket which can be ruined with inconsistent temps).

-I preheat my Egg for 20 mins or so once it reaches the target temp (250F at the dome, should make it about 225F at the grill) and then I watch the smoke before putting the meat on. If you see thick billowing clouds of smoke from your smoker you're going to have a slighter bitter tasting smoke ring (especially if you use strong woods like hickory, pecan or mesquite). Let the wood burn a little bit and the smoke will calm down. Put the shoulder on and maintain the temp. Your smoke should be steady but light the whole time. 

-At 2 hours in, I start misting the shoulder every hour with a spray bottle. I use a 1 to 1 mix of apple cider vinegar and bourbon and mist thoroughly.

-I use a temperature probe in the meat to monitor the internal temp. Once the internal temp reaches 160F, I pull it off the pit and place it in a small disposable aluminum pan and cover it with foil, then let it finish cooking in the oven at 225F. "The Stall" begins right around 160F. -That's where the meat starts shrinking up and squeezing juices out. If you can wrap it in foil (or place it in a small pan covered with foil) before then, the meat will continue to cook in all it's juices. Makes a huge difference in the final product. Once you wrap it up, no more smoke will get into the meat so I alway finish in the oven so I don't have to babysit a temp guage any more.

-Once the internal temp reaches 200F I pull it out of the oven and check for tenderness. If you can slide a probe all the way through the meat and there is no resistance, or if you can pull the bone out cleanly without any effrt, you're done. If any part of the meat is giving resistance to the probe, stick it back in the oven and try again in half an hour. -Most likely, once the temp reaches 200F, you're good to go.

-When it's done, wrap it back up and place it in a cooler (no ice) and let it rest for at least an hour. It will maintain it's heat well and soak up more of those juices. After you've let it rest for a while (I've rested for as little as an hour and as much as 3 1/2), pour out most of the juices (there will be a ton of juice) and then pull the pork apart using your hands or a couple of forks. Some add bbq sauce at this point and let the hot meat soak up the flavor. I don't. I prefer to give the option of eating it without sauce - the way true BBQ should be. :)

Enjoy.
