Pork Shoulder/Boston Butt

This is my first time cooking one of these. I chose an 8lb butt and rubbed it down with two different rubs. I used 3 parts of one that is a salty, sweet and spicy and 1 part of a rub has more flavor from black pepper. The first rub is more memphis style and the second rub should lend a little flavor that is closer to a central Texas style. I injected the shoulder with Creole Butter and it's been sitting in the fridge over night.
