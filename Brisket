Central Texas Style Brisket

Everything starts with a good cut of meat. 

-When buying your brisket look for the flat to be consistently thick from where it begins at the point to the end where the butcher cut it. If it tapers off too much at the end, you're going to have a harder time cooking the meat evenly. 

-The next thing you want to look for is marbling. The brisket should have a good fat cap on one side with at least 1/4 inch of fat covering that entire side. If there is more, that's fine but you'll need to trim off the excess fat to about a 1/4 inch thick. The idea here is to have enough fat so that it keeps the meat moist while it cooks. Too much fat will not render completely and you'll end up with a fatty mess at the end. The flat is always going to be the leanest part of the cut, but you should try to find a brisket that shows some marbling - look at the sides where the butcher cut it and the top to get an idea of how much fat is distributed inside this area. The point will always be very well marbled. I try to find a brisket with a large point since that's the part that will hold the best flavor (my opinion) because of all the fat running through the meat. 

-The final thing to look for in a brisket is how the meat feels when you handle it. This is especially important in supermarket briskets as they are often frozen before being sold and may sit waiting to be purchased for a while. Look for any packaged date - the newer, the better. If you can easily fold the brisket over in half, and if the meat is generally pretty pliable, that's a great sign. If you can't, it either has a fat cap that is way too thick or it's an older cut of meat. Fresher is better.

Prepping the meat.

-If you bought your brisket at a supermarket, it may have already been trimmed for you. If not, you want to trim the fat cap down to 1/4 inch and keep an eye out for any stray pieces of meat or fat that the butcher left hanging on. Anything that hangs off or sticks out is just going to get burned up or dried out and should be trimmed off.

-I've tried injecting ingredients from butter to apple juice to beef broth and spices, but if I've got even a semi-decent cut of meat, I've found it always comes out best keeping things very simple. The night before I cook, I rub the brisket down with a generous amount of sea salt and course-ground black pepper and let it sit in the fridge until morning. That's it. There are a ton of good rubs out there depending on what you want to taste. My palette is very Central Texas Style which basically just means you let the meat speak for itself. A simple rub, some smoke and the flavor of the meat should be all you need. When I take the brisket out of the fridge in the morning, I always dust it again with sea salt and black pepper just before putting it on the pit.
