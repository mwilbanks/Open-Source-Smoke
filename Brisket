Central Texas Style Brisket

Everything starts with a good cut of meat. 

-When buying your brisket look for the flat to be consistently thick from where it begins at the point to the end where the butcher cut it. If it tapers off too much at the end, you're going to have a harder time cooking the meat evenly. 

-The next thing you want to look for is marbling. The brisket should have a good fat cap on one side with at least 1/4 inch of fat covering that entire side. If there is more, that's fine but you'll need to trim off the excess fat to about a 1/4 inch thick. The idea here is to have enough fat so that it keeps the meat moist while it cooks. Too much fat will not render completely and you'll end up with a fatty mess at the end. The flat is always going to be the leanest part of the cut, but you should try to find a brisket that shows some marbling - look at the sides where the butcher cut it and the top to get an idea of how much fat is distributed inside this area. The point will always be very well marbled. I try to find a brisket with a large point since that's the part that will hold the best flavor (my opinion) because of all the fat running through the meat. 

-The final thing to look for in a brisket is how the meat feels when you handle it. This is especially important in supermarket briskets as they are often frozen before being sold and may sit waiting to be purchased for a while. Look for any packaged date - the newer, the better. If you can easily fold the brisket over in half, and if the meat is generally pretty pliable, that's a great sign. If you can't, it either has a fat cap that is way too thick or it's an older cut of meat. Fresher is better.

Prepping the meat.

-If you bought your brisket at a supermarket, it may have already been trimmed for you. If not, you want to trim the fat cap down to 1/4 inch and keep an eye out for any stray pieces of meat or fat that the butcher left hanging on. Anything that hangs off or sticks out is just going to get burned up or dried out and should be trimmed off.

-I've tried injecting ingredients from butter to apple juice to beef broth and spices, but if I've got even a semi-decent cut of meat, I've found it always comes out best keeping things very simple. The night before I cook, I rub the brisket down with a generous amount of sea salt and course-ground black pepper and let it sit in the fridge until morning. That's it. There are a ton of good rubs out there depending on what you want to taste. My palette is very Central Texas Style which basically just means you let the meat speak for itself. A simple rub, some smoke and the flavor of the meat and fat should be all you need. When I take the brisket out of the fridge in the morning, I always dust it again with sea salt and black pepper just before putting it on the pit.

Setting up the bbq pit.

-Your wood choice is important. I prefer to cook with oak for any beef that is going to be cooking for long amounts of time. I love to grill with mesquite and pecan but since the flavor of the smoke is so intense, they can be over-powering when smoking meats for hours at a time if you're not careful. Hickory is a great smoking wood too but I prefer to pair it's flavor with pork instead of beef. Fruit woods (apple, cherry, etc.) have no place in the pit when cooking brisket.

-I cook with an extra-large Big Green Egg and use the ceramic Place Setter for indirect heat. For the base of the fire, I use all natural oak hardwood lump charcoal and then add oak wood chunks on top. After the fire is going, I put the Place Setter in and then put a drip tray full of almost-boiling water on top and then the grill on top of that. The water in the drip tray will help keep the brisket moist while cooking. When I use a bbq pit with a firebox on the side, I set up the fire the same way and place a tray of water on the grill right next to the opening where the heat and smoke flow into the cooking chamber.

The cook. This is where some controversy enters the recipe: Low and slow vs High heat.

Low and Slow:

-Anyone who has been cooking briskets for a long time will swear that the only correct way to cook them is low and slow. They say you should cook with a temp around 225F and let it go until it's done. Keeping a consistent temp is extremely important so you'll need to babysit your pit. Cooking time ranges between an hour and hour and 30 minutes per pound depending on the size and fat content of your brisket. Using the low and slow method you want to keep the lid closed as much as possible, only checking every once in a while to mist the brisket with some water or fill the drip tray with water. The more you open the lid, the longer your brisket will take to cook. The more the temp fluctuates, the harder it will be to produce a great brisket. So keep the lid closed and watch your temp guage closely. With a Big Green Egg, keeping the temp consistent is pretty easy once the fire has been going for a while. That said, keep a close eye on it to avoid temperature spikes.

-I use the fork test to find out when the brisket is done. -When you can easily slide a toothpick, bbq fork or some other probe in and out without feeling any resistance, it's ready. Check it at different areas and continue cooking until all are tender. I use a digital thermometer that stays in the center of the brisket the whole time. I don't start with the fork test until the brisket gets to about 195F internal temp.

-After removing from the bbq pit, wrap it in foil and let it sit to rest for at least an hour in a cooler (no ice). When you're ready to to slice it up it will still be hot and all the juices will have settled down in the meat.

High heat:

-The low and slow method is proven and you can cook a great brisket with it. You can also really screw up a brisket if you don't monitor things closely and the process takes a long time. A while back I heard about a high heat method of cooking briskets that was supposed to give the same end results but in half the time. After many tests with this method, it's my preferred cooking method for brisket.

-Set up the pit and prepare your fire the same way as with Low and Slow but instead of heating to a cooking temp of ~225F, you're aiming for a temp between 325F and 350F. On the Egg, I always keep the dome temp guage at 350F so it should be about 325F or 330F where the brisket is sitting on the grill. 

-For this method to work, you will need to use a digital meat thermometer that you can leave in the brisket while it's cooking and monitor the temp from a display outside the pit. This is crucial. If you don't have one of these thermometers, and don't want to buy one, use the low and slow method. Otherwise, you're going to end up with a giant smokey piece of beef jerky. You can spend plenty of money on these types of thermometers but I've been using a cheap one I picked up at the supermarket for $20 and it works great.

-Using a higher temp with a brisket will bring the internal temp up much quicker (obviously) so you'll want to watch your meat thermometer closely after you put the brisket on the grill. You're watching for an internal temp of 160F. Depending on your cut of meat, this could happen as quickly as 90 minutes or may take as long as 2 hours and 30 minutes (I've never had one take longer than that).

-Fat side up or fat side down on the pit? I know people that swear by it both ways. Generally, I tend to go fat side up, but I've had great results going fat side down too.

-When cooking briskets, whether cooking low and slow or high heat, the brisket will enter a cooking stage called "The Stall" at some point between 160F and 170F, depending on the cut of the meat. At this point, the brisket starts shrinking up and squeezing out internal juices. If you're using the low and slow method, you'll notice your internal temp has been steadily rising up to this point and then for a while (sometimes hours) it stalls and hangs out around the same temp range before starting to go back up again. With the high heat method, we take advantage of the stall to help cook the brisket faster.

-When your internal temp has reached 160F, take the brisket off the pit and wrap it tightly in several layers of foil. This is called The Texas Crunch. By doing this, we're going to trap in all the flavorful juices that are squeezed out during the stall and use them to cook the meat. You have a choice at this point: you can return the foil-wrapped brisket to the pit or just put it in the oven at 325F. I normally just put it in the oven at this point since all we need for the rest of the cooking time is consistent temperature, especially since any smoke from the pit will not penetrate the foil.

-Once the internal temp has reached 195F, I follow the same fork-test procedure mentioned above to determine when it's done and then let it rest for at least an hour. My total cook times with the high heat method have ranged from a little over 4 hours to 6 hours depending on the size and fat content of the meat. The end results are always consistent - juicey, tender and full of flavor. The main difference is in the appearance of the brisket. The low and slow method will yield a great, thick bark. With the high heat method, after wrapping the brisket in foil, the juices will wash off some of the bark. The flavor from the bark remains since that's what the meat is cooking in, but it definitely wont score highest in the appearance category of any serious bbq competition. If you're not looking to compete and just want to cook some great brisket, you'll be really happy with the high heat results.
